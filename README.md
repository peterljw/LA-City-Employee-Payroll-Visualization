# LA-City-Employee-Payroll-Visualization

This project aims to visualize and explore data of the payment and health cost data of LA city payroll by building an interactive R Shiny dashboard. The data is downloaded from [LA City Controllerâ€™s Office](https://controllerdata.lacity.org/Payroll/City-Employee-Payroll/pazn-qyym). The dashboard provides an overview of the payroll of years from 2013 to 2018 and focues on exploring the top earning employees and departments in each year. The dashboard also invesitgates the departments with the highest costs in average benefit cost. The dashboard allows the users to select the year as well as the number of observations to be displayed.
